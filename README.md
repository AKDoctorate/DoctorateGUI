# DoctorateGUI

GUI application for the [DoctoratePy](https://github.com/AKDoctorate/DoctoratePy) project.

## GUI

The GUI is a Godot 4 project. Godot 4 is in beta, however it's very stable and has significant improvements from Godot 3. If you would like to adjust the GUI yourself, Godot 4 can be obtained from dev snapshots in the official Godot news. The project is developed on [Godot 4 beta4](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/beta4/). 
To edit the project, load project.godot with a Godot 4 build.
To export an executable, follow the [Godot export guidelines](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html).
